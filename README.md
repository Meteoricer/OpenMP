now i have two simulations going on
bold3: hydrolysis rate is 0.66 / 60 * 1 / 0.66, all the others is the same, this is because bold2, with 0.66 / 60 * 7 / 0.66 hydrolysis rate the polymer ring is very unstable. So it should make it stable while lower the hydrolysis rate
bold$: hydrolysis rate is 0.66 / 60 * 7 / 0.66, while make depolymerization rate 0.33, this should also stalb the ring, but i'm not sure which depolymerization rate i should choose, this 0.33 is just for test.

There is another problem for this hydrolysis rate, now i only specify base rate, so the effective rate might be different, so i need to take a close look at it.
