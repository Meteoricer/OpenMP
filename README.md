still working
Now the problem is bundling, debundling and diffusion
for bundling, the problem might be that even for cases that it have more than 2 anchor, it still need to calculate diffusion, it will take a lot of time.
Also, for bundling, i might need to merge the small part into the big part.
But for diffusion, how did i deal with the sum of diffusion (propensity) and more than 2 anchor can not be diffused.
this is finished, now the problem is debundling, when they are the same bundling, when debundling, how can i solve the problem that i will need to construct the whole bundle when it will end up in the same bundling?
Now the speed is 60 minute for 17.34 second
Debundling is finished. Now deal with diffusion
Now the speed is 60 minute for 23.73 second, there is not a big speed up as it should be (now the time for debundling is roughly the same as bundling, so in theory there is a 2 time speed up), maybe because of check sumps?
Maybe the problem is rotation? Now i change rotation that after 100 times it does rotation for every possible polymer_unit,
60 minute for about 34 second
the drifting problem is still there, i tried both with hydrolysis and without hydrolysis, it is still there, and i don't know why.
The problem maybe because of polarize?
recorded several reaction direction result, there is about 5/1000 difference, but it is not much. Should not because of this.
still don't know the origin
I'm doing multiple test to see if it will have the same drifting
#maybe because of fragmentation?
#it is because of fragmentation
it might be the random number generator of fragmentation
