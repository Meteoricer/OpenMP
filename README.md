The frap is very hard for me now. It seems like the treadmilling is a hard constrain to push the turn over.

There are some difference between FtsZ and FtsA frap. 
1. when frap on the whole ring, FtsZ seems to recover very quickly, while FtsA is slower.
2. When frap on 1/3 of the ring, FtsZ seems to recover slower, but FtsA recover quckly.

There must be something happening
