Now the problem is bundling, debundling and diffusion
for bundling, the problem might be that even for cases that it have more than 2 anchor, it still need to calculate diffusion, it will take a lot of time.
Also, for bundling, i might need to merge the small part into the big part.
But for diffusion, how did i deal with the sum of diffusion (propensity) and more than 2 anchor can not be diffused.
#this is finished, now the problem is debundling, when they are the same bundling, when debundling, how can i solve the problem that i will need to construct the whole bundle when it will end up in the same bundling?
